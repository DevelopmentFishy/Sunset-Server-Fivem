# KQ_SMUGGLERS INSTALLATION GUIDE [ESX]

This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the KQ_SMUGGLERS script for FiveM. This script requires the ESX framework to be installed and running on your server.

## Step 0:
Before installing KQ_SMUGGLERS, make sure that the `kq_lootareas` script is already installed and started on your server. You can download and install `kq_lootareas` from https://kuzquality.com/package/5355106.

## Step 1:
After downloading the KQ_SMUGGLERS script, unzip the folder and place it in the `resources` directory on your FiveM server.

## Step 2:
Next, you need to import the `kq_smugglers.sql` file into your database. This will create data (items) required for the script to function properly. You can watch this video for instructions on how to import an SQL file into your database: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBbqDLXrZGY.

## Step 3:
Once the SQL file has been imported, open the `config.lua` file in the KQ_SMUGGLERS script folder and make sure that the correct framework is enabled.

## Step 4:
After the config file has been set up, add the KQ_SMUGGLERS script to your `server.cfg` file. Make sure that it's added **after** the ESX framework, so that it loads and starts properly.

## Step 5:
âš  Make sure that any script isn't preventing the plane nor pilot from spawning. Anti-cheats often have the `shamal` plane blacklisted!

- plane model = 'shamal'
- plane object model = 'ex_prop_exec_crashedp'
- pilot model = 's_m_m_pilot_01'
- cartel model = 'g_m_m_armlieut_01'

## Done
Enjoy the script

## Extra info

You may want to rename some of the items or use existing items. You can easily change all the items in the `config.lua` file
