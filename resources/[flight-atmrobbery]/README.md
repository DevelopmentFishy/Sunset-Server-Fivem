- Support available on discord (Open a ticket)
- Supports [QB/ESX/Standalone] Frameworks
- Supports Skills systems (EXP)
- Supports All emote menus
- Supports Ox_target and Ox_inventory
- Supports discord logs

- QBCore and ESX ready templates
- Full translation available
- Detailed README on how to install
- Exploitation protected, players can't do steps at the same time
- Players can't start another step if they are currently doing one
- Atms props/ Atms on the wall/ Stolen Atms / Rope are all synced for everyone

- Custom Atm props when pulled
- Custom Atm frames props (stays on the wall)
- Completely customizable minigames, can change each step seperately
- Atms get pulled by a rope attached to a vehicle
- Atms act as an object that can be pulled around with a rope
- Atms placed are saved after restart (Configurable)
- Change Core name
- Change Target name
- Police alert
- Drill animation/sound/effects
- Atms steps are synced through SQL for everyone, meaning people can do steps together
- Atms canâ€™t be robbed more than once per restart
- When placing down an Atm, you get to navigate how and where you want to place it
- Choose which vehicles can rob the Atms (Ex: only heavy vehicles)
- Completely customizable items/durations/animations/rewards
- Ability for players/cops to destroy the Atm (to stop criminals from cracking them)
- Chance for players to find jackpot atms (multiplied money, configurable)

- Everything framework related is opensource:
    Client:
        - Police dispatch
        - Function that is triggerd when an atm is robbed (Ex: add EXP)
        - Seperate minigame for each step for customizability
        - Exploit Zone creation/destruction
        - Progressbar
        - Emote execution
        - Several Framework functions
        - How police count is calculated

### Add this to server.cfg

```lua
ensure ox_lib -- (if thats the first time you download ox_lib this should be added right above your framework's ensure)
ensure [flight-atmrobbery]
```

### Add this to Renewed-Weaponscarry in the client file (Optional, **Not Required**)

[Renewed-Weaponscarry](https://github.com/Renewed-Scripts/Renewed-Weaponscarry)

```lua
    ["atmred"] =  { carry = true, model = "flight_atm_03", bone = 28422, x = 0.01, y = -0.22, z = -0.8, xr = 0.0,

```

```lua
    Renewed-Weaponscarry runs at 0.04ms in the resource monitor, you can change the Wait()
    for the loop where he is carrying the prop in their client file. Wait(1) Doesnt allow the
    player to run around with the prop in hand, If you change to Wait(50), the player will be
    able to run around with the prop in hand, but also runs at 0.00ms
```
